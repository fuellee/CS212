=========================================

Code for Udacity CS212 Design of Computer Programs

Unit 1
------
* `poker.py`
* `poker_refactored.py`
  one to one correspondence between hand of cards and interger paritition
* `shuffle.py` 
  need explaination form probabilistic perspective

* `seven_card_stud.py`
  choose the best hand(5 cards) from more than 5 cards
* `jokers_wild.py`
  `itertools.produce` to build the whole problem space  
  [constant] * [wildcard possiblilities ..] ...

Unit 2
------
* `time_calls.py`
  simple profile tool for function calls
* `solving_cryptarithmetic.py`
  example for using `eval`
* `fast_solver.py`
  - optimized version of `solving_cryptarithmetic.py`
  - use `eval` to compile frequently computed formula to function in python
  - when assembling strings to a legal function to feed `eval`, I feel missing Scheme. S-expr rocks!
